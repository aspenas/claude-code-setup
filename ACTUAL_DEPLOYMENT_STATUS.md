# Actual Deployment Status

## What You Did

You mentioned:
- Deployed the ZIP file to your Candlefish Grotto project on Netlify
- Using Netlify API (you have full owner/admin access via AWS secrets)

## What I Misunderstood

I incorrectly assumed you had set up "jonathon.candlefish.ai" when you said:
> "deployed the zip file setup on our candlefish grotto project netlify using API as SUBsite jonathon.candlefish.ai"

## Current Reality

1. **Files Deployed**: You uploaded the docs-site.zip to Netlify
2. **Netlify Site**: Lives under your Candlefish Grotto project
3. **URL**: Should be accessible at the Netlify-provided URL (e.g., `[site-name].netlify.app`)

## To Find Your Actual URL

Since you deployed via API to your Grotto project, the site should be at one of these:
- Your existing Grotto Netlify URL
- A new Netlify URL (check your Netlify dashboard)
- Or via API: Use your Netlify API key to list sites

## If You Want jonathon.candlefish.ai

You would need to:
1. Add the subdomain in your DNS provider
2. Configure it in Netlify's domain settings
3. Point it to your deployed site

## Original Plan vs Reality

- **Original Plan**: Deploy to docs.candlefish.ai
- **What I Prepared**: Documentation ready for any domain
- **What You Did**: Deployed to your Grotto project
- **What I Assumed**: That you created jonathon.candlefish.ai

Sorry for the confusion! Can you share the actual Netlify URL where you deployed it?
